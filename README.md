# EDA-Analysis-Data-Using-Streamlit
Python | Streamlit | Pandas | Seaborn | Matplotlib

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python and Streamlit. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering to uncover key insights about the passengers aboard the Titanic. The project demonstrates the use of popular Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization, and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application.

Key Features:
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values and duplicates.
- Visualizations: Age distribution, gender distribution, and survival rate by passenger class.
- Feature engineering: Creating a new feature for family size.
- Interactive web app: Built with Streamlit for easy exploration of the dataset.
